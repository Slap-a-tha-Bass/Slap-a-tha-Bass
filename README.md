- 👋 Hi, I’m Corey!
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and throwing errors...sometimes computers.
- 🌱 I finished a full stack development course using TypeScript/React and Node.js/Express.js.
- 👌🏼 I'm efficient at styled-components for styling.
- 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m currently learning Nextjs and trying my hand at some Solidity. 
- 🧠 I’m looking to gain more experience/knowledge and meet new people in the industry.
